# winnerChecker

When checking the winning lottery combination in the CALottery website, the list is a bit confusing because the data is sorted by 
the number of matches. There is no option to sort it by date, and so if you want to check if a combination is close a recent winner,
it will be very difficult.

This script will allow you to list the previous winners that closely matches your combination by draw date.

## Documentation

This script will allow you to perform the following.

1. Select a data file for the Fantasy Five game in CALottery. This can be downloaded from the CALottery website.

2. Enter a five-digit combination that will be checked for close matches with the winners in the data file selected.

### NOTE ###

This script is still a work in progress.
