# winnerChecker

When checking the winning lottery combination in the CALottery website, the list is a bit confusing because the data is sorted by 
the number of matches. There is no option to sort it by date, and so if you want to check if a combination is close a recent winner,
it will be very difficult.

This script will allow you to list the previous winners that closely matches your combination by draw date.
